Candidate skipped during Stage 1 due to error: one of the variables needed for gradient computation has been modified by an inplace operation: [torch.cuda.FloatTensor [64, 1024]], which is output 0 of ReluBackward0, is at version 2; expected version 1 instead. Hint: the backtrace further above shows the operation that failed to compute its gradient. The variable in question was changed in there or anywhere later. Good luck!
